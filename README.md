## Markup Language
[Markup Language from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language)
- **Markup** refers to data included in an electronic document which is distinct from the document's content in that it is typically not included in representations of the document for end users
- A **markup language** is a set of rules governing what markup information may be included in a document and how it is combined with the content of the document in a way to facilitate use by humans and computer programs.
- The idea and terminology evolved from the **"marking up"** of paper manuscripts (i.e., the revision instructions by editors 편집자 수정지침).
- **Markdown** ([Markdown from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)) is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor (John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown, 2004).
